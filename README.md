# Econometrics techniques

Econometrics is an empirical of economics that applies mathematical and
 statistical models with economic theories to understand, explain and measure causality
 in economic systems, strategic decisions, the tech industry, and business.

## Difference-in-Differences

The difference-in-differences method is a quasi-experimental approach that compares 
the changes in outcomes over time between a population enrolled in a program (the treatment group) and 
a population that is not (the comparison group). It is a useful tool for data analysis.

## Regression Discontinuity Design

Regression Discontinuity Design (RDD) is a quasi-experimental evaluation option that
 measures the impact of an intervention, or treatment, by applying a treatment assignment 
mechanism based on a continuous eligibility index which is a variable with a continuous distribution.


## Propensity Score Matching

The propensity score is the probability of treatment assignment conditional on 
observed baseline characteristics. The propensity score allows one to design and analyze 
an observational (nonrandomized) study so that it mimics some of the particular characteristics 
of a randomized controlled trial. In particular, the propensity score is a balancing score: 
conditional on the propensity score, the distribution of observed baseline covariates 
will be similar between treated and untreated subjects.

## Survival Analysis

Survival Analysis is a field of statistical tools used to assess the time until an event occurs. As the
 name implies, this “event” could be death (of humans with a particular disease process, crops or plants
 under certain conditions, animals, etc.), but it also could be any number of alternatives
 (the failure of a structural beam or engineering component, the reoccurrence of a disease process,
customer churn rate, etc.).
